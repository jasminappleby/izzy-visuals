# Development Log

24/11/2025

Started with running `npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts` to create this react project

Added `npm i react-router` to add routing. 

Installed `nvm install 24`

Googled routing in React Vite and it showed me how to do this on the React website. Loads of sources. 
Isreal and I spoke about how his gallery page wants to look, and he wants his three niches to branch out. 
The current website tree looks like:

Home 
About 
Gallery
    Events
    Sports
    Lifestyle
Contact

This could easily grow more, but I am now aware of how to route things.
